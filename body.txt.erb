Not all garbage is collected every week. 

   - Combustible items are collected on Tuesdays and Fridays
  
   - Plastic containers, plastic wrappings, and Recycleable paper are collected every Monday
     
    - Noncombustible-Garbage, Cans, PET-bottles (The 1st, 3rd, 5th  week)
  
  -  Glass Bottles (The 2nd, 4th week)
  
Please notice that during large holidays (e.g Golden week) only burnable garbage is collected. See attached charts for details

Garbage station mangers are requested to pay attention to the following:

1. Please unfold the containers for recyclables (plastic,
    pet-bottles, cans, and glass bottles/jars) on Sunday
    evening, the day before the garbage collection of these kinds.
    Please see the following web sites for information about
    garbage collection days and about how to sort garbage.

2. During the week that you are on garbage collection duty,
    please keep the garbage area clean. If wrongly sorted
    garbage is left in the garbage area, please sort this garbage
    properly so that it can be collected on the garbage
    collection day. Make sure that all bags containing
    burnable trash (food remains, etc.) are enclosed behind
    the garbage area gate so that cats cannot get to them.
    Please clean the garbage area at least once.

3. If you will not be here when you are scheduled for
    garbage duty, please find a neighbor to cover for you.

4. Please kindly inform anybody who you find throwing out
    garbage on the wrong day or not following the rules for
    disposing of garbage.

Your kind cooperation will be greatly appreciated!!

Note: If you have any requests/questions etc. to FHA, please send
an email to <add email>.
